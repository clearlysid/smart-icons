# Smart Icons

Allows you to paste in one or many SVG icons and change their size and colour from the Framer interface easily.

**Note:** Intended for simple, monochrome icons only.

## Usage

The package contains two components:

### 1. IconSingle

This has `fill`, `stroke` and SVG code inputs (where you paste your code)

### 2. IconMulti

Similar options as IconSingle, but you can add as many SVG icons in a list as you want, and use the `current` number to select which one to render.

This allows you to have all the icons of your Design System in a single, tidy, component.
